# data-size-sort

This is a short interactive game developed in Unity. It is designed to teach students about data volume, specifically the terminology of data sizes and some real world examples to associate with these terms. **data-size-sort** was developed by University of Delaware students for the [CS Field Guide's](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/index.html) Big Data chapter (as of yet, unpublished) as a part of the requirements for CISC 374 (Educational Video Game Design).

## Known Issues
